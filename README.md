# Bounded-Buffer-Producer-Consumer-using-Message-Passing allowing asynchronous communication.

Created a bounded producer-consumer with a buffer that runs concurrently with the producer-consumer processes.

Using JCSP library for channels to pass data between processes, to create a buffer that can handle multiple items at a time and send them to the consumer process whenever it requests a product,
allowing asynchronous communication between producer and consumer. 

This also allows multiple producers and consumers to access a single buffer.
